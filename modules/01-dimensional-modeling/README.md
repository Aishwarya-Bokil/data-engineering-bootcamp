# Sessionization with SQL

## Problem
Describe the assignment in your own words. Include inputs, outputs, and edge cases.

## My Approach
- Key design decisions
- Tradeoffs
- Assumptions

## Environment Setup
```bash
# Optional: create venv
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Add any Docker/Flink/Spark commands necessary to reproduce.

## How to Run
```bash
# Example
python src/main.py --input data/input.csv --output data/output.parquet
```

## Results
- Screenshots, sample outputs, or metrics
- What worked / what you would improve next

## Notes
- Links, references, and future work
