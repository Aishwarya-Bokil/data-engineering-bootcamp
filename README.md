Each module has:
- A short description of the problem.  
- My approach and reasoning.  

⚠️ **Note:** This repo is **not intended to run standalone**. It depends on the official bootcamp instructions, environments, and datasets. Use it as a reference alongside the bootcamp.

## Quick Start

1. Enroll in and follow Zach Wilson’s Data Engineering Bootcamp.
2. Clone the zach's data-engineering repo. Follow instructions for each module.
   git clone https://github.com/DataExpert-io/data-engineer-handbook/tree/main/intermediate-bootcamp
3. Clone this repo to your machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aishwarya-Bokil/data-engineering-bootcamp.git
   cd data-engineering-bootcamp


## Modules
- **01 — Dimensional Data Modeling**: Organizing raw data into dimension tables that capture descriptive attributes (who, what, where, when) to support efficient analysis. 
- **02 — Docker Basics**: Designing fact tables that store measurable business events (sales, clicks, transactions) with a clear grain for analytical queries.
- **03 — Spark Fundamentals**: Part 1: Explore broadcast and bucket joins and perform data aggregation. Part 2: Test data quality in spark
- **04 — Applying Analytical Patterns**: Working with common analytical patterns like state change tracking. Performing efficient aggregation. Working with window functions.
- **05 — Streaming Pipelines**: Building a streaming pipeline that can sessionize input data using Flink.
